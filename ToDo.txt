#1 -DONE: update this web project to be a REAL MVC project with Controllers, Views and Model.  Post back to the Controllers, etc!
#2 - DRAW UP AN ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM of what your major assemblies are, and how you are keeping them decoupled!!  Your website
	should be decoupled from your entities and models really.  If it were a 3rd party consuming site it would be don't you think?
	What is the interaction diagram for an AJAX client on this site?  Do you ever post back to the site itself, or just to the REST services?
	If so, why do you need th controllers, wouldn't the old version of the site work just fine?
	Do this, take the best of both, and put all your views w/o controllers in the Views folder, change MapRoute to find those.  This way,
	controllers are optional.
