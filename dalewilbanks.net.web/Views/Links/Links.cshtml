<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu" target="_blank" />Scot Gu's blog</a> -  Corporate Vice President in the Microsoft Server and Tools Business. He has the inside scoop on the latest / greatest technologies coming out of Redmond.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank"/>Joel On Software</a> - Joel Spolsky provides some of the most practical advice on software development you'll find.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank"/>Stack Overflow</a> - Joel's brain child for developer collaboration.  It's <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/3/stack-overflow-architecture-update-now-at-95-million-page-vi.html" target="_blank">built</a> using jQuery/MVC3/C#/SqlServer (same technology stack as this site) which is my recommendation for most web apps going forward.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idesign.net/" target="_blank"/>IDesign.Net</a> - IDesign is an architecture power house: Juval Lowy, Brian Noyes, Dino Esposito and more.  This team has written more MSDN articles between them than any group you'll find. Juval is one of the people MS goes to for advice: in 2008 he was kind enough to provide our team design guidance on SOA, and at the time he was in Redmond advising the WCF team on their release of WCF 1.0.  Juval's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-NET-Components-Juval-Lowy/dp/0596102070/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1326060662&sr=8-4" target="_blank"">Programming .NET Compoents</a> was a watershed moment for me. It opened my eyes to the low coupling / hi cohesivness principles behind component oriented programming.  Juval's <a href="http://www.idesign.net/idesign/download/IDesignMethod.zip" target="_blank">IDesign Method</a> (aka simply as "the method")
is an architectural tour de force that no architect should be without.  In my career, I've been a disciple of the method, and followed IDesign's <a href="http://idesign.net/idesign/download/IDesign%20CSharp%20Coding%20Standard.zip" target="_blank">C# Coding Standard</a> as <u>the</u> way to write C#.
The free resources that you'll find on this site are indispensable. If you get a chance to take an IDesign Master Architect training course, do not pass it up.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sensible.com/" target="_blank">sensible.com</a>  - Steve Krug, the author of <a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html" target="_blank">"Don't Make Me Think"</a>, the seminal Bible on UX (user experience).  If you've never read this book <em>buy it now</em>, buy copies for all your friends, memorize it, then live it.  "Don't Make Me Think" is a watershed in the movement towards usable web sites / applications.  This book continues to power the UX design philosphy of RightContent.</p>
