1- CSS Concepts
Cascading Inheritance - Styles defined at the parent level cascade to child elements.
 Demo this using Chrome tools to turn off fonts at body level, then turn them on on an li element.

We are cascading from body down, but there is an even higher level from the browser.

 Browsers provide a default set of styles, but that can vary from one browser to another, or from one user to another.
 Users can even define their own default CSS using a User Stylesheet.  Show user agent stylesheet in Chrome Dev Tools
 Reset CSS -  Browsers provide a default set of styles, which you can 'reset' using a Reset.css
 Uncomment the Reset CSS to show how it removes all style definition.
 Uncomment all our element styles to show our element style definitions. 

CSS Box Model - The edges of elements on the page are defined by a box.
	    Change the Reset.css to cause every element to be box bordered.

CSS Selectors  -  review the basic ones on WC3Schools
Styles apply from least specific match to most specific. (ex. element overrides *, #id overrides .class)
Edit CSS, give * { background-color: red} and give h1{background-color: blue}


2- Prototype Your Layout
Mock up a prototype layout: Whiteboard, Paper, or PowerPoint
	Show what we did for World bank

Create HTML mockup, Use file:// for easy saves

Define each area as a DIV
  Nesting of DIVs is crucial to proper layout.


Fill each DIV with test content

Define the style of the ul.navigation li

Define container class, define column class

Set Margins and Padding

Resize and confirm wrapping behavior

Test in each target browser
