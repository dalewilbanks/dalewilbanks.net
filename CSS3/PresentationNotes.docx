1- CSS Concepts
Cascading Inheritance - Styles defined at the parent level cascade to child elements.
 Demo this using Chrome tools to turn off fonts at body level, then turn them on on an li element.

Reset CSS -  Browsers provide a default set of styles, which you can 'reset' using a Reset.css
        We are cascading from body down, but there is an even higher level from the browser.
        Discuss the concept that every browser provides default CSS
		Users can even define their own default CSS using a User Stylesheet.

CSS Box Model - The edges of elements on the page are defined by a box.
	    Change the Reset.css to cause every element to be box bordered.

CSS Selectors  -  review the basic ones on WC3Schools
Styles apply from least specific match to most specific. (ex. element overrides *, #id overrides .class)


2- Prototype Your Layout

Mock up a prototype layout: Whiteboard, Paper, or PowerPoint
Use file:// for easy saves
Define each area as a DIV
Fill each DIV with test content
Set Margins and Padding
Resize and confirm wrapping behavior
Test in each target browser
